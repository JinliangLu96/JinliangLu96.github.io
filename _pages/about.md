### Research Interest
My research interest lies in natural language processing. Currently, my focus is on exploring model-fusion techniques, refining decoding strategies, and investigating the multilinguality of large language models (LLMs). In the past, I dedicated in unsupervised machine translation and parameter-efficient tuning of pre-trained language models.
